# Image Mapper

A simple image coordinate mapper for Pulsar.

## Use

1. Open an image in Pulsar
2. Make sure image zoom is not set to `Auto`, it must be set to a percentage.
3. Run the `Image Mapper:Map` command using the command palette, context menu, or with a shortcut key (default is `Alt+I M`).
4. Click anywhere on the image you would like to copy the coordinates of.
5. Run the `Image Mapper:Map` command again to stop mapping. A notification will pop up with the mapped coordinates and with the option to export them to a new file.
